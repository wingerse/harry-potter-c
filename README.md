# Harry potter
Another harry potter clone written in C using SDL2. It lacks a lot of features compared to [C# version](https://github.com/wingerse/harry-potter-game), and has some bugs.  
I stopped working on this after getting tired of writing C.  

To compile, edit the Makefile to point to correct SDL library and include paths. Make ./bin/ and ./obj/, copy ./res/ to ./bin/ and then do `make`.  
You need SDL2, SDL_image, and SDL_mixer. Don't forget to put the dlls into ./bin/
